          <p>
            My plans after graduating from Neumont University in September 2027
            are to pursue a career in software development or game development,
            hopefully utilizing the
            <em>Enterprise Projects</em> to get a job with one of the companies
            that I work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of my peers have expressed interest in pursuing indie game
            development, after watching the constant flux of the AAA game
            industry and its treatment of both employees and consumers. After
            consideration, I have seen their points and might do the same after
            careful financial planning. We have, also, thought of starting an
            indie game studio with the graduates of my Cohort if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            A career that would greatly interest me would be a remote-work job
            that allowed me to stay at home most days and work on my own
            projects during my free time. This would allow me to focus on
            building my own games and software in my off time, while still
            earning a steady income to support myself.
